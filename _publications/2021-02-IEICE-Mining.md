Blockchain technology has been used in many fields, including the Internet of Things. However, IoT devices are considered resource-limited to mine blocks with the PoW algorithm in a reasonable time. We demonstrate the feasibility of mining on Raspberry Pi 4 for private Ethereum blockchain, one of the most popular blockchain platforms. Ethereum has a mechanism to adjust mining tasks' difficulty dynamically. Thus, it can be adapted to mine blocks on IoT devices. Moreover, we also find the mining time follows the exponential distribution. The expected value of mining time is 11.07 seconds.
