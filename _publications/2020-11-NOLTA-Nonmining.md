In this paper, we aim to monitor the performance of the real devices (i.e., Raspberry Pi), which form a blockchain using the popular private Ethereum. We use on-device tools to track disk space usage, memory usage, CPU utilization, and network throughput on non-mining nodes. The collected results within two hours show that it is feasible to monitor the nodes while running the Ethereum private network.
